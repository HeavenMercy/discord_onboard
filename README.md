# Discord Onboarding

This is a little project of how I learned to create a Discord bot.

I made it clear and somewhat documented for it to be easy to understand and replicate.

the `doc` folder contains the cheatsheet related to the project and what I've learned until the last commit.


## Requirements

(optional) you can create a virtual environment for this project.

1. Install the necessary packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Place your bot Key inside `data/bot_key.txt`

3. Modify things and experiment! (üßê I am watching...  you better do it!)

Enjoy! if you have any issue, question, or such, don't hesitate to knock (maybe with a ticket in `Issues`, never mind).
