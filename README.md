# Discord Onboarding

This is a little project of when I learned how to create a discord bot.

I made is clear and somewhat documented for it to be easy to understandable and replicated.

the `doc` folder contains the cheatsheet related to the project and what I've learned until the last commit.

## Requirements

(optional) you can create a virtuel environment for this project.

1. Install the packages needed: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

2. Place your bot Key inside: `data/bot_key.txt`

3. Modify things and experiment ! _I am watching, you better do it!_

Enjoy! if you have any issue, question or such, don't hesitate to knock (maybe with a ticket in `Issues`, nevermind).
